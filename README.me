# Password Brute Force and Common Guessing Tool

This Python program is designed to test password strength by attempting to brute force a password and check if it matches any commonly used passwords. The tool can be useful for educational purposes, security awareness, or testing the robustness of passwords in a controlled environment.

## Features
- **Common Password Check**: Compares the given password against a list of 10,000 of the most common passwords stored in `words.txt`.
- **Brute Force Attack**: Attempts to guess the password using all possible combinations of:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Optional digits
  - Optional symbols
- **Dynamic Length Adjustment**: Supports brute-forcing passwords of lengths between 3 and 5 characters.

## How It Works
1. The program first checks if the password matches any common password in `words.txt`.
2. If no match is found, it proceeds to brute-force the password by:
   - Generating all possible combinations of characters for specified lengths.
   - Comparing each generated guess against the target password.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Place the list of common passwords in a file named `words.txt` in the same directory as the script. The `words.txt` file should contain 10,000 of the most common passwords, one per line.

## Usage
1. Open the script and set the `password` variable in the `main()` function to the password you want to test:
   ```python
   password: str = 'Password1' # Add password here to brute force
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
View the results:

If the password matches a common password, it will display the match.
If not, it will attempt brute-force guessing and display the result.
Example Output
Common Password Match:
python
Copy code
Searching...
Common match: password123 (#12)
0.03 s
Brute Force Match:
arduino
Copy code
Searching...
"abc1" was cracked in 1,234 guesses
5.67 s
No Match Found:
lua
Copy code
Searching...
There was no match...
6.45 s
File Structure
main.py: The Python script containing the program logic.
words.txt: A text file containing 10,000 of the most common passwords, one per line.
Customization
Password Length: Adjust the range in the main() function:
python
Copy code
for i in range(3, 6):  # Modify the range as needed
Character Set: Enable or disable digits and symbols in the brute_force function:
python
Copy code
brute_force(password, length=i, digits=True, symbols=False)

### Key Updates:
1. **Mentioned `words.txt` Details**:
   - Explicitly stated that `words.txt` contains 10,000 of the most common passwords.
2. **File Structure Section**:
   - Clarified that `words.txt` is a required file in the same directory as the script.
